# Data concatenation 
The showing code is an example of how to concat data from two different API endpoints.

## How does it work?
In this case, a new ArrayList will be created with the posts and the ```userName``` new property will be added (this space of memory is where the name of the username will be stored).<br />
Keep in mind that each post has an userId, and each user has an Id of said user.
